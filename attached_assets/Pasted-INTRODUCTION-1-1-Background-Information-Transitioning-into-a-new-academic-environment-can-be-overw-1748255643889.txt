INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background Information
Transitioning into a new academic environment can be overwhelming for fresh students, especially when navigating an unfamiliar campus and managing class schedules. Many institutions rely on traditional orientation programs, printed maps, and manual timetable management, which may not be efficient or easily accessible.

Campus Buddy is a lightweight web-based application designed to simplify campus navigation and academic scheduling for new students. It provides an interactive map of the campus, a class scheduler, and time-based reminders to ensure students can locate lecture halls, manage their timetables, and receive alerts for upcoming classes. By integrating these features into a single platform, the system aims to enhance the onboarding experience for new students and reduce the confusion associated with campus navigation.

1.2 Problem Definition
1.2.1 Description of the Current System
Currently, new students rely on:

Physical maps or signposts for navigation.

Manual timetable tracking (paper or basic digital tools like Excel).

Word-of-mouth directions from peers or staff.

Generic university apps that may not focus on navigation and scheduling.

1.2.2 How the Current System Works
Students receive a printed map during orientation.

They manually note down class schedules.

No automated reminders for class changes or locations.

Limited real-time updates on room changes or campus events.

1.2.3 Weaknesses of the Current System
Inefficient navigation: Static maps are hard to update and lack interactivity.

No smart scheduling: Students must manually track class times and locations.

No reminders: Risk of missing classes due to forgetfulness.

Poor accessibility: Not all students carry physical maps or planners.

1.2.4 Proposed Solution
Campus Buddy provides:
✔ An interactive clickable map of campus buildings and nearby facilities.
✔ A digital class scheduler for inputting and viewing daily timetables.
✔ Automated reminders for upcoming classes.
✔ A user-friendly web interface accessible on any device.

1.3 Project Objectives
1.3.1 General Objective
To develop a smart web-based guide and scheduler that helps new students navigate their campus efficiently and manage class schedules seamlessly.

1.3.2 Specific Objectives (SMART Approach)
i. To study existing campus navigation and scheduling solutions and identify gaps.
ii. To analyze challenges faced by new students in campus navigation and time management.
iii. To design and develop a lightweight web application with interactive maps, scheduling, and reminder features.
iv. To implement and test the system in a real-world academic environment.

1.4 Research Questions
i. What are the existing solutions for campus navigation and student scheduling, and what are their limitations?
ii. What challenges do new students face in navigating campuses and managing class schedules?
iii. How can a web-based smart guide and scheduler improve campus navigation and time management?
iv. How effective is the proposed system when tested with real users?

1.5 Justification
This project is important because:

Reduces stress for new students adapting to campus life.

Improves punctuality with automated class reminders.

Enhances accessibility (no need for physical maps or planners).

Saves time by providing real-time location guidance.
